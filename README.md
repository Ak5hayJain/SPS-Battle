# ✊🖐✌️ SPS-Battle

A fun and interactive **Stone-Paper-Scissors** game built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Challenge the computer and see who wins — the logic is simple but addictive! This is an improved version of a simpler Stone-Paper-Scissors game I created earlier, enhanced to include computer choice display and refined UI.

## 🎮 How to Play

- Click on **Stone**, **Paper**, or **Scissors** to make your move.
- The computer will automatically choose its move.
- Results are instantly shown along with both choices.
- Win, lose, or draw — play as many rounds as you like!

## 🌟 Features

- 🧠 Computer-generated choices using random logic
- 👁️ Visual representation of both player and computer picks
- 🏆 Instant win/loss/draw result display
- 🔁 Replayable game loop with no page reload
- 💡 Built entirely using vanilla web technologies
